            STORY
            </h2>
            
            <p>
            Pathologic follows the efforts of three doctors when a deadly plague hits a small village in the Russian steppe.
            <br>
            Each character has a different perspective as a result of their experiences during the epidemic.
            <br>
            These different perspectives lead the characters to find radically different solutions to ending the pandemic.
            </p>

                                    Daniil Dankovsky, a Bachelor of Medicine, is researching ways to forestall and overcome death. His research has not been fruitful, but when he receives a letter speaking of a seemingly immortal man in a small village in the Russian steppe, he takes the first train he can to speak to and study this man.<br>

                                    Unfortunately, upon arriving, he discovers that the immortal man, Simon Kain, was killed shortly before his arrival. Dankovsky investigates the circumstances of his death, and finds he was not murdered. Rather, he died of a rare disease that is extremely deadly and spreads extremely quickly. <br>

                                    Now the Bachelor is tasked with curbing the pandemic and saving the town. In his efforts, he comes to discover a solution to both the plague, and his research.

                                Artemy Burahk is a man who grew up in the Town-on-Gorkon. He left home years ago in order to study to become a surgeon at the capital. But when he receives word that his father is dying, he returns home. <br>

                                But upon returning he learns that his dad has already passed on. In addition to his grief, Burahk is now tasked with becoming a menku, a position of authority in his culture that he has inherited from his father. <br>

                                But with the plague spreading, he finds there may be no town left if he does not find a cure to save everyone.

                            Clara the Changeling is an enigmatic figure. She has no past. She merely awoke in an open grave, birthed by the earth. She has powers beyond ordinary humans and knowledge that she could not possibly have. <br>

                            Fortunately, her powers allow her to cure the infected. She seems to be a miraculous good omen. But her twin sister has also been birthed by the earth, and her powers are much more cruel. <br>

                            With some calling her a saint and others calling her a demon, saving the town is much harder than what one would initially expect.
